## Abstract
Patents are often associated with innovation and R&D activities and are accepted as the proven signal of technological development within a firm. Thus, they can be used as an evaluation indicator to estimate the business performance of firms. This thesis aims to examine the relationship between economic performance on the firm level and patents in climate change mitigation technologies (CCMTs), so-called "green patents". It predicts the financial performance of firms based on the corpus of green patents using an NLP approach. The analysis is done on a dataset of green patents that were published by the European Patent Office (EPO) between 2010 and 2019. Firm-level assets and revenue are selected as a financial proxy, and predictions are performed for short, mid and long-term changes in firms’ financial performance. The experimental results show that the BERT model pre-trained on patent corpus outperforms standard BERT models. Yet, linear machine learning models SVM and Naive Bayes yield better predictive performance in this task. Furthermore, the findings indicate a strong link between green patents and the total assets of firms, especially in the long-run performance of firms.
